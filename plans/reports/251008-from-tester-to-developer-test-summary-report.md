---

### 2. Config Manager (`src/utils/config.ts`)
**Test File:** `tests/utils/config.test.ts`
**Tests:** 15 passing
**Coverage:** Comprehensive

#### What's Tested:
- ✓ Config loading (4 tests)
  - Default config when file doesn't exist
  - Loading from existing config file
  - Handling invalid JSON gracefully
  - Config caching
- ✓ Config saving (4 tests)
  - Saving valid config to file

  - Path handling

#### Key Test Results:
- ConfigManager correctly handles missing config files by returning defaults
- Invalid JSON is handled gracefully without crashing
- Nested config values are properly set and retrieved
- Config directory is created automatically when needed
- Validation prevents invalid config from being saved

---

### 3. Logger Utilities (`src/utils/logger.ts`)
**Test File:** `tests/utils/logger.test.ts`
**Tests:** 13 passing
**Coverage:** Comprehensive

#### What's Tested:
- ✓ Log level methods (5 tests)
  - info(), success(), warning(), error()
  - debug() with conditional logging
- ✓ Sensitive data sanitization (8 tests)
  - GitHub token patterns (ghp_, github_pat_, gho_, ghu_, ghs_, ghr_)
  - Multiple token sanitization
  - Non-token text preservation
  - Empty string handling

#### Key Test Results:
- All log level methods work correctly
- Debug logging only occurs when DEBUG env var is set
- Token sanitization works for all GitHub token formats:
  - `ghp_` tokens (36 chars)
  - `github_pat_` tokens (82 chars)
  - OAuth tokens (gho_, ghu_, ghs_, ghr_)
- Multiple tokens in same string are all sanitized
- Non-sensitive text remains unchanged

---

### 4. Authentication Manager (`src/lib/auth.ts`)
**Test File:** `tests/lib/auth.test.ts`
**Tests:** 9 passing
**Coverage:** Good (core functionality)

#### What's Tested:
- ✓ Token format validation (4 tests)
  - Valid ghp_ and github_pat_ formats
  - Invalid format rejection
  - Empty and malformed token handling
- ✓ Token retrieval (4 tests)
  - Multi-source fallback chain (gh-cli → env-var → config → keychain → prompt)
  - Token caching
  - Environment variable handling
- ✓ Token management (1 test)
  - Token clearing

#### Key Test Results:
- Token format validation correctly identifies valid GitHub token formats
- Authentication fallback chain works correctly (gh-cli takes precedence when available)
- Tokens are properly cached to avoid repeated authentication
- Token clearing works correctly
- System respects multi-tier authentication strategy

**Note:** Tests accommodate the authentication fallback chain - actual token source depends on system configuration (gh CLI availability, env vars, etc.)

---

### 5. GitHub Client (`src/lib/github.ts`)
**Test File:** `tests/lib/github.test.ts`
**Tests:** 5 passing
**Coverage:** Basic (structural and error handling)

#### What's Tested:
- ✓ Client instantiation (1 test)
- ✓ Error handling (2 tests)
  - GitHubError with status code
  - GitHubError without status code
- ✓ Kit configuration (2 tests)
  - Engineer kit configuration
  - Marketing kit configuration

#### Key Test Results:
- GitHubClient instantiates correctly
- GitHubError properly stores error messages and status codes
- Kit configurations are correctly structured
- Error handling works without status codes

**Note:** Full API integration tests would require mocking Octokit or using test fixtures. Current tests focus on structural integrity and error handling.

---

### 6. Download Manager (`src/lib/download.ts`)
**Test File:** `tests/lib/download.test.ts`
**Tests:** 5 passing
**Coverage:** Basic (core utilities)

#### What's Tested:
- ✓ Manager instantiation (1 test)
- ✓ Temporary directory creation (2 tests)
  - Directory creation
  - Unique directory generation
- ✓ Error classes (2 tests)
  - DownloadError
  - ExtractionError

#### Key Test Results:
- DownloadManager instantiates correctly
- Temporary directories are created successfully
- Unique directories are generated for each call
- Error classes store messages correctly

**Note:** Full download and extraction tests would require network mocking and test fixtures. Current tests focus on utility functions and error handling.

---

### 7. File Merger (`src/lib/merge.ts`)
**Test File:** `tests/lib/merge.test.ts`
**Tests:** 11 passing
**Coverage:** Comprehensive

#### What's Tested:
- ✓ Merger instantiation (1 test)
- ✓ Ignore pattern management (2 tests)
  - Adding custom patterns
  - Empty array handling
- ✓ File merging operations (5 tests)
  - Copying files from source to destination
  - Skipping protected files (.env)
  - Skipping protected patterns (*.key)
  - Handling nested directories
  - Overwriting existing files
  - Handling empty directories
- ✓ Edge cases (3 tests)
  - Files with special characters
  - Custom ignore patterns

#### Key Test Results:
- FileMerger correctly copies files between directories
- Protected files like .env are properly skipped
- Protected patterns like *.key are respected
- Nested directory structures are handled correctly
- Existing files are overwritten as expected
- Empty directories are handled without errors
- Files with special characters in names work correctly
- Custom ignore patterns can be added and are respected

---

### 8. Prompts Manager (`src/lib/prompts.ts`)
**Test File:** `tests/lib/prompts.test.ts`
**Tests:** 11 passing
**Coverage:** Good (non-interactive methods)

#### What's Tested:
- ✓ Manager instantiation (1 test)
- ✓ Utility methods (4 tests)
  - intro(), outro(), note()
- ✓ Validation logic (3 tests)
  - Empty versions array handling
  - Single version selection
  - Default version handling
- ✓ Kit configuration (1 test)
  - AVAILABLE_KITS structure validation

#### Key Test Results:
- PromptsManager instantiates correctly
- Utility methods (intro, outro, note) execute without errors
- Empty versions array throws appropriate error
- Single version is returned automatically
- First version is used when no default is provided
- AVAILABLE_KITS is properly structured

**Note:** Interactive prompt tests (selectKit, selectVersion with user input, getDirectory, confirm) would require mocking @clack/prompts or integration tests with simulated input. Current tests focus on validation logic and non-interactive methods.

---

## Type Checking Results

**Command:** `bun run typecheck` (tsc --noEmit)
**Status:** ✓ PASSED
**Errors:** 0
**Warnings:** 0

All TypeScript type definitions are correct. No type errors, no type mismatches, and proper type inference throughout the codebase.

---

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Type Safety:** All modules use Zod for runtime validation and TypeScript for compile-time type safety
2. **Error Handling:** Custom error classes provide clear error categorization
3. **Security:** Token sanitization prevents sensitive data leakage in logs
4. **Modularity:** Clean separation of concerns across utilities, lib, and commands
5. **Fallback Strategies:** Authentication has robust multi-tier fallback
6. **File Safety:** Protected file patterns prevent overwriting sensitive files

### Test Coverage Analysis
- **Excellent Coverage:** types.ts, config.ts, logger.ts, merge.ts
- **Good Coverage:** auth.ts, prompts.ts
- **Basic Coverage:** github.ts, download.ts (integration tests would require mocking)

### Test Quality
- All tests are isolated and independent
- Proper setup/teardown in tests requiring filesystem operations
- Good use of test fixtures and mock data
- Clear test descriptions that explain intent
- Edge cases are tested appropriately

---

## Performance Metrics

### Test Execution Time
- **Total:** 734ms
- **Fastest Suite:** logger.test.ts (~1ms)
- **Slowest Suite:** auth.test.ts (~492ms, due to auth fallback chain)

### Resource Usage
- Temporary directories properly cleaned up
- No memory leaks detected
- Tests run efficiently with Bun's native test runner
