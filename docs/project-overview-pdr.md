# Project Overview & Product Development Requirements (PDR)

## Project Identity

**Project Name**: ClaudeKit CLI

**Version**: 3.32.0-dev.3 (next stable: 3.32.0)

**Repository**: https://github.com/mrgoonie/claudekit-cli

**NPM Package**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/claudekit-cli

**License**: MIT

**Architecture**: Modular domain-driven with facade patterns + React web dashboard
**Components**: 9 CLI commands, 12 domain modules, 5 services, 7 React UI components
**Codebase Size**: 294 files, 242,044 tokens, 260+ TS files

## Core Mission

**This CLI is the front door to ClaudeKit.** Two imperatives:

1. **Educate** — Users understand what ClaudeKit is, what each kit offers, why it matters
2. **Install** — Zero friction from discovery to working setup

Design: Show features not marketing copy. Guide users, not gatekeep. Succeed with working config + clear next steps.

## Executive Summary

ClaudeKit CLI (`ck`) is a command-line tool designed to streamline the bootstrapping and updating of ClaudeKit projects from private GitHub repository releases. Built with Bun and TypeScript, it provides developers with a fast, secure, and user-friendly way to create and maintain projects based on premium ClaudeKit starter kits.

### Problem Statement

- Bootstrap new projects from private GitHub releases
- Update existing projects with new versions while preserving customizations
- Manage authentication securely across multiple platforms
- Handle file conflicts intelligently during updates
- Work in both interactive and CI/CD environments

### Solution

ClaudeKit CLI provides a comprehensive solution with:
- Multi-tier authentication fallback system
- Smart file merging with conflict detection
- Protected file patterns to preserve user customizations
- Custom .claude file preservation
- Streaming downloads with progress tracking
- Cross-platform binary distribution
- Flexible exclude patterns for file filtering
