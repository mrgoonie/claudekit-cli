feat: update package installation feature for dev branch merge

- Ensure package installation feature works correctly with dev branch
- Update CLI help documentation for package installation flags
- All tests passing for package installation functionality

This PR reopens the package installation feature (#25) to target dev branch instead of main,
since the selective directory update feature (#26) has already been merged to dev.
